ABOUT:
  This is a short (no, it's not short anymore :) perl  script to colorize'
  your logs. You can use your own colors, you can simply modify your config
  file in your home directory ($HOME), or system-wide (/etc/colorizerc).
  Some colors are shit, 'cause I was developing the script on my sisters'
  mono vga monitor. If you have a good "theme", I please you to send me,
  and I will put into the tarball.

INSTALL:
  Put somewhere in your path. Or just set the PATH environment variable.

  You will need a Perl module called Term::ANSIColor by Russ Allbery and
  Zenin (thanks for it).
	
  You can download from the CPAN archive:
    http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Term/
  or (when you use Debian GNU/Linux potato) simply type:
    apt-get install libansicolor-perl
  or (when you use Debian GNU/Linux woody or newer), it is in the
  perl-modules package.

USAGE:
  Just pipe the logs in the script, and	have fun.

EXAMPLES:
  cat /var/log/daemon.log | colorize
  tail -0f /var/log/daemon.log /var/log/apache/access.log | colorize
  colorize < /var/log/messages

TIPS:
  In TIPS file and in examples directory.
